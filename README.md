## Goals

1. Learn how to implement an Android app which connects, using __GCM__,
to a server-side app.
2. Learn how to make a server-side app with a __REST__ interface and
connections to GCM.

This project is divided in two parts: the Android client and the server app.
My own motivations for this project is to learn how to make a server side
app. I already know how to make Android apps but know very little about
web programming. So this will be outside of my comfort zone.

I have the following requirements for the project:

__Serverside:__
* Have a __REST__ api
* Use __GCM__
* Require login but don't handle passwords

__Androidside:__
* No passwords
* Get push updates through __GCM__
* Initial full sync on install using __REST__

## Server app
Step 1 will be to construct an app we can deploy on a webserver somewhere.
Go into the _server-app_ folder and see how that's done.

## Android app
Step 2 will be the Android app. This will be fairly straightforward. Have
a look in _android-client_ for that.

## Result
No result so far.

When finished, will link to apk and have the server running.
